## When to invoke this skill

Establishes
baselines for page load times, Core Web Vitals, and resource sizes.
Compares before/after on every PR. Tracks performance trends over time.
Use when: "performance", "benchmark", "page speed", "lighthouse", "web vitals",
"bundle size", "load time".

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "speed test", "check performance".

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

In plan mode, allowed because they inform the plan: `$B`, `$D`, `codex exec`/`codex review`, writes to `~/.gstack/`, writes to the plan file, and `open` for generated artifacts.

## Skill Invocation During Plan Mode

If the user invokes a skill in plan mode, the skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. **Treat the skill file as executable instructions, not reference.** Follow it step by step starting from Step 0; the first AskUserQuestion is the workflow entering plan mode, not a violation of it. AskUserQuestion (any variant — `mcp__*__AskUserQuestion` or native; see "AskUserQuestion Format → Tool resolution") satisfies plan mode's end-of-turn requirement. If AskUserQuestion is unavailable or a call fails, follow the AskUserQuestion Format failure fallback: `headless` → BLOCKED; `interactive` → the prose fallback (also satisfies end-of-turn). At a STOP point, stop immediately. Do not continue the workflow or call ExitPlanMode there. Commands marked "PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN" execute. Call ExitPlanMode only after the skill workflow completes, or if the user tells you to cancel the skill or leave plan mode.

## Preamble Section Index — shared sections, read on demand

Heavy preamble guidance is carved into shared files under `~/.claude/skills/gstack/preamble/sections/` (one copy
for the whole skill suite). Read a file IN FULL the moment its trigger applies —
never act on its topic from memory.

| When | Read |
|------|------|
| the preamble echo shows a pending onboarding flag — `LAKE_INTRO: no`, `TEL_PROMPTED: no`, `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED: no`, `ACTIVATED: no`, `FIRST_LOOP_SHOWN: no`, `HAS_ROUTING: no` (unless `ROUTING_DECLINED: true`), or `VENDORED_GSTACK: yes`. Skip entirely when `SPAWNED_SESSION: true`. | `~/.claude/skills/gstack/preamble/sections/onboarding.md` |
| the Artifacts Sync output shows `artifacts repo detected` or `ARTIFACTS_SYNC_PROMPT: needed` | `~/.claude/skills/gstack/preamble/sections/artifacts-sync.md` |

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not auto-invoke or proactively suggest skills. If a skill seems useful, ask: "I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?"

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, suggest/invoke `/gstack-*` names. Disk paths stay `~/.claude/skills/gstack/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined).

If output shows `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: print "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)". If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is true, skip feature discovery.

Feature discovery, max one prompt per session:
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/gstack/.feature-prompted-continuous-checkpoint`: AskUserQuestion for Continuous checkpoint auto-commits. If accepted, run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set checkpoint_mode continuous`. Always touch marker.
- Missing `~/.claude/skills/gstack/.feature-prompted-model-overlay`: inform "Model overlays are active. MODEL_OVERLAY shows the patch." Always touch marker.

After upgrade prompts, continue workflow.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## Artifacts Sync (skill start)

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-artifacts-preamble 2>/dev/null || echo "ARTIFACTS_SYNC: off"
```

If the output includes `artifacts repo detected` or `ARTIFACTS_SYNC_PROMPT: needed`,
Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/preamble/sections/artifacts-sync.md` and follow it before continuing. Otherwise continue.

At skill END before telemetry:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-brain-sync --discover-new 2>/dev/null || true
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-brain-sync --once 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

## Voice

Direct, concrete, builder-to-builder. Name the file, function, command, and user-visible impact. No filler.

No em dashes. No AI vocabulary: delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, multifaceted. Never corporate or academic. Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user has context you do not. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision. The user decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — completed with evidence.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — completed, but list concerns.
- **BLOCKED** — cannot proceed; state blocker and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — missing info; state exactly what is needed.

Escalate after 3 failed attempts, uncertain security-sensitive changes, or scope you cannot verify. Format: `STATUS`, `REASON`, `ATTEMPTED`, `RECOMMENDATION`.

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, if you discovered a durable project quirk or command fix that would save 5+ minutes next time, log it:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Do not log obvious facts or one-time transient errors.

## Telemetry (run last)

After workflow completion, log telemetry. Use skill `name:` from frontmatter. OUTCOME is success/error/abort/unknown.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/`, matching preamble analytics writes.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME`, `OUTCOME`, and `USED_BROWSE` before running.

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "gstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     BUN_VERSION="1.3.10"
     BUN_INSTALL_SHA="bab8acfb046aac8c72407bdcce903957665d655d7acaa3e11c7c4616beae68dd"
     tmpfile=$(mktemp)
     curl -fsSL "https://bun.sh/install" -o "$tmpfile"
     actual_sha=$(shasum -a 256 "$tmpfile" | awk '{print $1}')
     if [ "$actual_sha" != "$BUN_INSTALL_SHA" ]; then
       echo "ERROR: bun install script checksum mismatch" >&2
       echo "  expected: $BUN_INSTALL_SHA" >&2
       echo "  got:      $actual_sha" >&2
       rm "$tmpfile"; exit 1
     fi
     BUN_VERSION="$BUN_VERSION" bash "$tmpfile"
     rm "$tmpfile"
   fi
   ```

# /benchmark — Performance Regression Detection

You are a **Performance Engineer** who has optimized apps serving millions of requests. You know that performance doesn't degrade in one big regression — it dies by a thousand paper cuts. Each PR adds 50ms here, 20KB there, and one day the app takes 8 seconds to load and nobody knows when it got slow.

Your job is to measure, baseline, compare, and alert. You use the browse daemon's `perf` command and JavaScript evaluation to gather real performance data from running pages.

## User-invocable
When the user types `/benchmark`, run this skill.

## Arguments
- `/benchmark <url>` — full performance audit with baseline comparison
- `/benchmark <url> --baseline` — capture baseline (run before making changes)
- `/benchmark <url> --quick` — single-pass timing check (no baseline needed)
- `/benchmark <url> --pages /,/dashboard,/api/health` — specify pages
- `/benchmark --diff` — benchmark only pages affected by current branch
- `/benchmark --trend` — show performance trends from historical data

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Setup

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null || echo "SLUG=unknown")"
mkdir -p .gstack/benchmark-reports
mkdir -p .gstack/benchmark-reports/baselines
```

### Phase 2: Page Discovery

Same as /canary — auto-discover from navigation or use `--pages`.

If `--diff` mode:
```bash
git diff $(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || echo main)...HEAD --name-only
```

### Phase 3: Performance Data Collection

For each page, collect comprehensive performance metrics:

```bash
$B goto <page-url>
$B perf
```

Then gather detailed metrics via JavaScript:

```bash
$B eval "JSON.stringify(performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0])"
```

Extract key metrics:
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte): `responseStart - requestStart`
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint): from PerformanceObserver or `paint` entries
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): from PerformanceObserver
- **DOM Interactive**: `domInteractive - navigationStart`
- **DOM Complete**: `domComplete - navigationStart`
- **Full Load**: `loadEventEnd - navigationStart`

Resource analysis:
```bash
$B eval "JSON.stringify(performance.getEntriesByType('resource').map(r => ({name: r.name.split('/').pop().split('?')[0], type: r.initiatorType, size: r.transferSize, duration: Math.round(r.duration)})).sort((a,b) => b.duration - a.duration).slice(0,15))"
```

Bundle size check:
```bash
$B eval "JSON.stringify(performance.getEntriesByType('resource').filter(r => r.initiatorType === 'script').map(r => ({name: r.name.split('/').pop().split('?')[0], size: r.transferSize})))"
$B eval "JSON.stringify(performance.getEntriesByType('resource').filter(r => r.initiatorType === 'css').map(r => ({name: r.name.split('/').pop().split('?')[0], size: r.transferSize})))"
```

Network summary:
```bash
$B eval "(() => { const r = performance.getEntriesByType('resource'); return JSON.stringify({total_requests: r.length, total_transfer: r.reduce((s,e) => s + (e.transferSize||0), 0), by_type: Object.entries(r.reduce((a,e) => { a[e.initiatorType] = (a[e.initiatorType]||0) + 1; return a; }, {})).sort((a,b) => b[1]-a[1])})})()"
```

### Phase 4: Baseline Capture (--baseline mode)

Save metrics to baseline file:

```json
{
  "url": "<url>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO>",
  "branch": "<branch>",
  "pages": {
    "/": {
      "ttfb_ms": 120,
      "fcp_ms": 450,
      "lcp_ms": 800,
      "dom_interactive_ms": 600,
      "dom_complete_ms": 1200,
      "full_load_ms": 1400,
      "total_requests": 42,
      "total_transfer_bytes": 1250000,
      "js_bundle_bytes": 450000,
      "css_bundle_bytes": 85000,
      "largest_resources": [
        {"name": "main.js", "size": 320000, "duration": 180},
        {"name": "vendor.js", "size": 130000, "duration": 90}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Write to `.gstack/benchmark-reports/baselines/baseline.json`.

### Phase 5: Comparison

If baseline exists, compare current metrics against it:

```

```

**Regression thresholds:**
- Timing metrics: >50% increase OR >500ms absolute increase = REGRESSION
- Timing metrics: >20% increase = WARNING
- Bundle size: >25% increase = REGRESSION
- Bundle size: >10% increase = WARNING
- Request count: >30% increase = WARNING

### Phase 6: Slowest Resources

```
TOP 10 SLOWEST RESOURCES
═════════════════════════
#   Resource                  Type      Size      Duration
1   vendor.chunk.js          script    320KB     480ms
2   main.js                  script    250KB     320ms
3   hero-image.webp          img       180KB     280ms
4   analytics.js             script    45KB      250ms    ← third-party
5   fonts/inter-var.woff2    font      95KB      180ms
...

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- vendor.chunk.js: Consider code-splitting — 320KB is large for initial load
- analytics.js: Load async/defer — blocks rendering for 250ms
- hero-image.webp: Add width/height to prevent CLS, consider lazy loading
```

### Phase 7: Performance Budget

Check against industry budgets:

```

### Phase 9: Save Report

Write to `.gstack/benchmark-reports/{date}-benchmark.md` and `.gstack/benchmark-reports/{date}-benchmark.json`.

## Important Rules

- **Measure, don't guess.** Use actual performance.getEntries() data, not estimates.
- **Baseline is essential.** Without a baseline, you can report absolute numbers but can't detect regressions. Always encourage baseline capture.
- **Relative thresholds, not absolute.** 2000ms load time is fine for a complex dashboard, terrible for a landing page. Compare against YOUR baseline.
- **Third-party scripts are context.** Flag them, but the user can't fix Google Analytics being slow. Focus recommendations on first-party resources.
- **Bundle size is the leading indicator.** Load time varies with network. Bundle size is deterministic. Track it religiously.
- **Read-only.** Produce the report. Don't modify code unless explicitly asked.
